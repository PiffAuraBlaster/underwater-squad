My code is a simple iteration of the classic game, Rock, Paper, Scissors.

The rules to the game are simple.
Rock beats scissors.
Scissors beats paper.
Paper beats rock.

In order to run my game you must install two things, the first of which is Ruby which can be found with instructions to install here:

The second of which is a library known as GOSU which can be found with instructions to install here:

To run the game, run RPS.rb using Ruby.
In order to play the game you click the image of the move you would like to play for that round and the computer will automatically pick a move.
After that round if you win, you get a point.
If the computer wins they get a point.
If you draw, the round is thrown out and you replay the round.
The first to 3 points wins.
After that you must exit the game by pressing ESC and run it again if you wish to play again.

All the images were drawn by myself using microsoft paint.
